possibilities of being degenerately many. That is clearly where we consider the
different laws of nature, with parameters only changed from static to anything
dynamic. A clear visualisation would be to keep any physical equation unchanged
except varying any constant in it, which will produce a distinct motion that
isn’t captured inside the preconceived law(s) of nature. Therefore the
supposition that <b>the reason in language is sufficient enough to capture the
reason in nature</b>, is rudimentary in epitomising phenomena in natural
science. What follows in this article, with the exposition of foundational
questions in the epistemological basis of science and sense; will be directed
towards a <b>Science of Sense.</b> </p>

The necessity of distinguishing <b>what can be said to be true </b>or, <b>what

the sufficiency of language and the totality of senses. This is further
involved in dissecting <b>logical necessity</b> and <b>natural necessity</b>
corresponding to a possibility in the category of thoughts. The sole purpose of
being sceptical regarding nature, reason and language is their virtues of
explainability, with arbitrary coherence; although with enough room for
inconsistency always <a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><sup><sup><span

<u>We must not take for granted the ability to speak and sense</u>; as this is
the key ingredient behind saying - <i>There is at least one Universe with
theories about the Universe in it</i>, where the sole originator is nothing but
beings like us, with common-enough intelligibility. It’s phenomenal how a thing
like ‘language’ and ‘reasoning’ came about under very spontaneous planetary
morphisms, and is capable enough to produce possibilities beyond the
constraints of this planetary nature - i.e. you can imagine, say or write about
yourself flying in the sky; or anything arbitrary, since <b>language
necessarily totalizes all things that can be said, or are apparently true</b>.  
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>                               
Therefore further question arises - <b>what essential features does an
expression must satisfy in order to be coherent enough to appear as a truthful
possibility? </b>The question hinges around things that can be said but has
nothing to do with what is strictly possible in nature. This is the section of <i>representability
of expressions in every I-Language</i>, where it seems to us that - thoughts
generated in cognitive-faculties can be such that its truth, defies natural
constraints or laws of nature, although being a very consistent sense, i.e. I
am swimming in the clouds - is logically consistent and makes proper sense -
but can never be a natural possibility. Thus it is obvious, and depicts the<b>
emergence of un-nature from within nature </b>with the whole process of
emergence still being a <b>natural </b>one, and will be exploited later on. <a

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><b>                                                             
</b>Turing machines are turing-complete systems, but the Turing System as I
mention here is a quite different object. It is a system for probing the
fundamental nature of Deductive and Inductive Systems. [Logic is being induced
in the system and that’s where Syllogism, which is actually a simple deductive
system finds its differences from logical induction]. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>                                                 
         Thus logic as we’ve built it isn’t an instance or a thing, it is a
system, but nature is altogether the whole thing, and complexity allows
contingency at each level of spontaneity which makes nature un-smooth as
fractals. Our empirical evidence hugely validates that, in fact with heavy
ubiquity. On the other hand, the analytical construction of Turing Systems can
be quite dilemmatic but we can speculate a possibility. Given a formal system,
the truths that are intuitional but unprovable from within the system are the
ones that are Unprovable truths, and Turing Systems <b>T:(P, S, N) -&gt; {0,1}</b>

therefore probes the Nature of Logic at its fundamentals. Further studies on
this matter might lead us to <i>Geist Ist Immanent Unentscheidbar, </i>as
Turing himself considered Oracle Machines, in parallel with mind.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>                              At
one end we have <b>a thing</b> and then<b> the sense of the thin</b>g. In fact
there are <b>many things that exist only through the sense of it</b>, <i>with
no form at the physical level</i> [2, God and all such humane constructions
exist only in its sense and not by consuming any physical volume at all]. That
is the reason language allows you to make poetry and stay formal both, although
at distinct ends of a <b>Superspectrum</b>. Episteme is this superspectrum -
the totality (spectrum) we can generate in making senses (Both a derogatory and
sophisticated use of language have sense but has distinct styles, which aren’t
universal and won’t be bothered by us - meaning that content of an expression
in language, if represents a real phenomenon, must not depend on how it’s been
said or the representation). </p>

Kant’s distinction of <i>noumenon</i> and <i>phenomenon</i> is at the heart of
Universal Ontology, which says - regarding any intelligible acquisition of
sense, there can only be representation of the <i>thing in itself</i> in terms
of a phenomenon or <i>the thing for itself</i>, thereby the <i>noumenon</i> is
strictly out of the episteme and all we have are its functions as in how it
interacts with everything else. Considering how Rovelli [2] puts forward his - <span
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Courier New"'>Relations
are all there is, </span>we have the clarity that <i><u>thing</u></i><u> has
nothing to do with <i>reality,</i></u> indicating that the parallelism between <b><i>thing
&amp; noumenon</i></b> would give us equivalently consistent ontology as what
Kant and Rovelli prescribed. But still, as I consider the <i>logic of nature(<u>ex</u>)</i>
the general presupposition underneath is that, the reason in nature is immanent
and strictly indifferent to the choice of representation of the observer[1],
which is another extension of <b>Universality of Natural Laws</b>, given a
definite scale of interaction [for emergentism and scale-dependence of physical
laws, look at [1] as it contains detailed exposition on this matter]. Further
on, <i>Spinoza</i>, in his <i>Ethics</i> proposes: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Which sufficiently demonstrated
the scope of reasonability as well as the horizon of our cognition, since
beyond that, there must always persist an undetectable possibility that a
deduction is absolute nonsense, and thus no consequence of the reasonable
(logical) system can be considerably upheld to be a truth. Therefore what
remains in front of us, is <b>the scope of immant reason</b> which is intrinsic
to every relation in certainty, giving us : <b>reason is the only thing in
