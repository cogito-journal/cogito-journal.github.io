<p class=MsoNormal>Study of inanimate objects being the discourse of science
naturally carries the question about existence of animate things in perception.
It is just what’s there in physical existence, that constitute the mind and
cognition, although the instantaneous reality can have utter variances among
individual minds, simply the fact that perception cannot be embodied in a
finite state computation, distinguishes the spectrum of its complexity, than
that of inanimate ones. For long literature and philosophy has jargoned about
mind endlessly, each speculating their own possibilities to tie up reality and
perception, but only have hindered the progress of scientific analysis of
causation and perception; along which direction, resides the theory of thought,
mind and all those that were seemingly metaphysical for thousands of years and
maybe information theory can tell us something novel here. Although empirical
evidence enforces the monic physical realism unlike solipsism, but at the same
time the instantaneous realisation of subjectivity in one conscious body exerts
its own truth value. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In analysing matters that previously weren’t considered <i>natural</i>,
like acquisition of information, synthesis of so, and extrapolation of
knowledge, or let along perceiving an internal thought or external object - in
terms of analytical and scientific paradigm, one requires to consider the wide
range of possibilities from simple<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><sup><sup><span

quantum observation and acquisition of information to the phenomena in much
higher complexity level - subjective observations of seemingly classical
continuum. It appears that the complexity levels might enemerge<a href="#_ftn2"

different sets of properties to characterise the objects, but to ensure our
trajectory it is straightforward that a process like <b>the act of observation </b>is
common to both the spectrum, concluding a general structure of the process
itself, apart from the description of complexity level it is acting upon. A
thorough contemplation yields a much richer structure between observation,
knowledge and logic, based on which every possible understanding takes place in
cognition, and that logical structuralisation of an entity in perception, in
terms of language, has a very close relation with observability. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One extreme subtlety we don’t discuss often, yet extremely
use it always, is the idea that - if it is true then it should be so, or that
if it is true, it is necessarily so; and, ‘therefore there must be sufficient
reason behind why it is the case and not anything else’. this is true for every
phenomenon that totalizes nature. Isn’t that what natural science does when new
observations are made from unknown causes? They consider - since it is
naturally (given the constraints of observation {apparatus arrangement}) the
case, and not anything else - an invariant state that is an invariant to
“causation operator” - there must be a reason behind so. It’s nothing but
scientific investigation, which has at its heart the assumption of PoSR. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>                    To know is to
observe, and to understand is to know - this necessary part of <i>the process

<p class=MsoNormal>                                                 Some
dualities are omni-persistent, quite innate to the structure of existence
itself. Literature has a few names for them like Subjective
experience-/-objective reality, mind-/-matter, phenomenon-/-noumenon and
likewise. What they wish to capture is essentially the distinction between <b>what
is the case </b>and <b>what can be the case.</b> The later one is in the
logical space of the observer, who pictures all other possibilities that give
the same observation - is the reality, whereas the former, where one physical
realisation has taken place, is the <u>actual</u> event. <b>Reality is a
representation of this actuality</b>, without which whatever actually happens
(in nature) wouldn’t make any sense afterall. At the same time, individual
minds are perceiving their internal and external environment<a href="#_ftn4"
name="_ftnref4" title=""><sup><sup><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:
115%;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>[4]</span></sup></sup></a> always, and
some representations are impossible in actuality. By this I consider the
entirety of possibilities that human mind <b>can</b> represent, has certain
constructions that aren’t <i>actually tru</i>e [a subjective dream, any such
object that is indecomposable to atoms, yet exists in the form of a
representation ]. Therefore,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Actuality: </b>The truth behind the process (complete
information of its trajectory in hilbert space)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Reality: </b>   The truth about the process (macroscopic

<p class=MsoNormal>At the same time any fundamental matter functions in a very
peculiar way when an <i>observer</i> intervenes in the path of its evolution -
it freaking changes to a state that is invariant to the operation of “being
found out” <a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><sup><sup><span

[2], i.e. in the Copenhagenian term - collapses or in Everettian term -
branche. But now just use <b>PoSR</b>, why does it act like that? and who is
that observer? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Unfortunately only the later has a satisfactory answer but
not the former. W. Zurek [2] says, an observer can be anything that interacts,
anything that can accept, or give-off force carriers like photons. Just as a
molecule can <i>observe</i> another one, due to the variance in the charge density,
wrapping electromagnetic fields inside a chemical solution, or a planet can <i>observe<b>
</b></i>distant black-hole merge due to gravitational waves that periodically
distorts its shape; likewise a subjective being <i>observes</i> its unconscious
responses in a dream, or observes a semantic form (meaning) by understanding
it. Clearly an observer from theoretical science seems to have a close
connection with consciousness as a subjective observer (such as those of an
inanimate observer but with origin from much different complexity level), and
we can extend the spectrum of observability to even subjective ones, and
attempt in answering - PoSR behind emergence of subject and consciousness. From
now on the observer can be anything and we can see clearly, consciousness is strongly
correlated to this whole business of understanding and making sense out of
arbitrariness. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But attempting to answer about the specialty of observation,
the former question, i.e. why does it act like that, when observed a very
sensitive system; it becomes rather unclear, since the nature of observation
seemed to have been hidden under the rug by philosophers and interpreters of
quantum mechanics. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I’d rather consider, since observation seems fundamental to
things that exist, there should be sufficient reason behind why necessarily it
is the case, just usual PoSR we’ve been discussing. </p>

developments by considering observers themselves to be open systems, interacting

once one <i>act of observation </i>takes place, it falls one of its pointer

states are chosen by the constraints of the environment, and observation
collapses the system to one of such states. In fact one can derive the Born’s

Understanding a thing at its fundamentals is being able to measure it, or
rather formalise a proper measure, suitable for quantities of that thing. Who
wondered if a species would invent natural numbers, let alone quaternions,
which are nothing but <i>measurement of countability </i>and its
higher-dimensional generalisation. Likewise we have been able to suitably
assign measure to kinematics of inanimate matters, since they involve simple
quantities like length, mass and charges, but following the idea of P.
Anderson’s <b>more is different, </b>how can we expect much more complex
structures to have only such measures as its fundamental constituents, rather
its suitable to think of them having different quantities, which are yet unmeasurable.
But phenomenological experience, just as Newton or Kepler did about celestial
mechanics, led Neuroscientist Julio Tononi, Physicist Max Tegmark and
Philosopher David Chalmers to devise <i>a theory to measure consciousness</i>.
In fact they did with few assumptions like <i>Cause-Effect Power</i>, <i>Empiricism
and Emergentism</i>, and showed consciousness to be an intrinsic entity to the
subject and put forward a measure of intrinsic-information content of a complex
system, or somewhat of a measure of complexity - <b><span style='color:#202122;

integration of information from several modalities in our body, i.e. visual,

sense that - “p is possible” is equivalent to “~p is not necessary”, that is,
“it is never necessary that ~p is the case” which in turn means “p is possibly
the case”. In this way, the possibility is totalized by the range of its
necessity, and beyond which it cannot necessarily be the case and thus becomes
impossible. This in turn further strengthens how “what is possibly the case”,
that which is observable in reality (representational) constructs knowledge,

<p class=MsoNormal>Noam Chomsky in his 1993 paper <i>A minimalist program for
linguistic theory </i>introduced a syntactic-structural formalisation of the
idea MERGE, where two syntagma combines (coarse grains) into one, i.e. two
syntagma merges into one. He managed to show that such an act of MERGE is
ubiquitous in all forms of language, and therefore not at all specific to
language rather general to universal grammar itself. Later on in a paper [4],
Physicist Roman Orus and Linguist Angel J. Gallego, both from Spain formalised
this idea in terms of (Syntactic) Tensor Networks, where the MERGE operation as
been formalised to take two inputs and give off an output, i.e. MERGE: X, Y <b><span
style='font-size:10.5pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Arial Unicode MS";
background:white'>→ </span></b>Q . In the diagram beside, δ = M<sup>[1]</sup>{α,
β} and μ = M<sup>[2]</sup>{γ, δ}. Likewise given a syntagma, one can construct
a tensor network tree, representing syntactic decomposition of the expression,
and it can be understood as renormalisation of information at each scale of
MERGing operation, i.e. once each MERGE takes place we wash away redundant
degrees of freedom, and deal with renormalised (MERGEd) information only. Work
on comparative cognition has endorsed the insight that - </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“<span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>Only humans appear
to possess a mental grammar - an “<b>I</b>-Language” where “<b>I</b>” stands
for <i>Intentional, Internal and Individual - </i>that allows us to create
infinitely many meaningful expressions from a finite stock of discrete units …
However, the knowledge of such fundamental rules (the so called reductionism)
does not imply a priori the knowledge of the emergent laws for aggregates of
many fundamental entities (the so-called emergentism)</span> ”<b> </b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Therefore like scale-transformation of statistical mechanics<b><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:115%'>, </span></b>MERGE in linguistics
entails Information-renormalization in physics. A coarse-graining of
information means the removal of superfluous degrees of freedom in order to
describe a given physical system at a different (coarse-grained) scale.
Combined with rescaling, it is the procedure entailing renormalization by which
the rules describing the macroscopic equation emerge from those describing the
microscopic. Chomsky’s MERGE operation entails the renormalization of syntactic
information, moreover the renormalization accounts for different <i>time-scales</i>.

<p class=MsoNormal>The sense extrapolated from the expression - “the man from
Boston drives well the car” resides at the topmost renormalised scale (z<sub>4</sub>
here), likewise in exactly similar formal procedure one extracts essence from a
paragraph by considering each of its sentences each leaf nodes, and likewise
for a chapter, its paragraphs are the leaf nodes, and upto the furthest point,
the <i>whole semantic sense </i>of a text can be extrapolated by quantifying a <i>Semantic
Tensor Network</i> like syntactic one described in [4]. Indeed without
reduction of superfluous degrees of freedom, it would be unbearably difficult
to go through any form in language, let alone long text, and that we can do it
after all, is due to the structure of language itself - which renormalizes
information by virtue of its usage. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This monograph is dedicated to closely analyse the the role
of identifying and functionally demystifying Subject as nothing but an <i>intrinsic
observer</i>, where in addition to usual measurement of external agency, it has
capability to co-measure what’s intrinsic to itself, and therefore identify
consciousness from inanimate objects that are only capable of extrinsic
observations. Besides the logic in language along with representation of
picture as facts, are made clear in this paradigm of a description of
observation that holds both for subjects of extreme high internal complexity to
objects of identically no complexity within whatsoever (structure with no
further decomposable structure).  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Targeting the rudimentary symmetry
might ease the task of explaining a phenomenon upto great certainty for a wide
range of complexity levels. In this case, the knowledge yielded by observation
carries the structure of the symmetry that prevails from atomic observation to
subjective observation, only that its form and manifestation change only, not the
content. Such a formalisation holding for this wide range of complexity is a
non-trivial task although much richer formalization is possible and will be the
next task, to polish it into a theory of observation. </p>
