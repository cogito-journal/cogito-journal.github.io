            <b>On Subjectivity & Meaning</b>: <q>I think, therefore I am.</q> The first significant determination of
Subjectivity belongs to Descartes (Discourse on the Method, 1637). This of course coincides with a
line of thought which finds its (rational) conclusion in Substance Dualism (Mind-Body problem).
Cartesian Dualism, as is generally known, has been subject to various criticism from various schools
of thought, but the general rationale - the question of Subjectivity as such, has been at best
disavowed (far from being resolved as people might believe). This prompts a deeper investigation,
on our part, to the ontological status of Cartesian Cogito (Res Cogitans being the substance of Mind).
The Cartesian point of injunction, far from being one of metaphysical obscurity, is the very
spontaneous phenomenological experience of one's Will as an inseparable condition for Existence.
That is, our everyday experience of existence is intimately associated with our ability 'to think as we
will'.
        </p>
        <p>
            [ It must also be noted, to avoid misinterpretations (manifold as they are), that the Cartesian
condition for existence involves Recognition of the same. It is obvious thus, why the Cartesian Cogito
cannot be generally attributed to other species. Existence must be purely autonomous in its
disclosure (being recognised by the 'user').]
        </p>
        <p>
            It is necessary to take into account historical circumstances to delineate the considerations and
implications of Descartes's move. At a time when 'Mechanistic Philosophy' was in full-throttle
pioneered by the likes of Galileo, it came to be tacitly assumed that 'humans (or the universe in fact)
are complicated machinery' - that is, in principle it is possible to construct an infinitely complex
machine with cogs and wheels and such, to mimic Human (and thereby be so). The Human,
therefore, is an infinitely complex mechanism. Whereas, the Cartesian Space for Subjectivity is one
which eludes mechanisms, or rather, eludes representation in and as mechanisms.
Suppose any regular conversation we are engaged in. There is, of course, a comprehensive
mechanistic description of the event - upon neurochemical activation vocal cords vibrate to
generate sound as in the vibration of atmospheric molecules reaching the ears of the listener,
generating again a series of vibrations neurochemically decoded, to generate corresponding
response and so on. Appealing once again to our spontaneous recognition of Will, it appears that we
(our Subjective Space) minimally control the fate of such a conversation - I can choose to talk about
other things or walk away etc. Descartes's point is that this Will does not feature at the level of
mechanisms. <b>As such, Human Subjectivity is not an infinitely complex mechanism, but merely
    absent from this plane of mechanisms.</b> {Unfortunately, this has earned the Cartesian Subject a
rather derogatory (albeit somewhat fashionable) epithet - 'Ghost in the Machine'/Gilbert Ryle}
[There is an obscure but nonetheless profound metaphor on the matter involving a physicist
simulating ab-initio (and reducing thus) Tolstoy's War & Peace, only to tragically end up producing
indices/page numbers of a book. Much like, any attempt to get to the content of a conversation
from the plane of mechanisms can only peripherally punctuate what's signified.]

        </p>

        <p>
            from the plane of mechanisms can only peripherally punctuate what's signified.]
It is possible to infinitely reflect on instances where the Cartesian Ghost shows up in discourse, well
distant from core Philosophy. Recall John Searle's Chinese Room Experiment - a defence of
Subjectivity of sorts, against what was (and is) a misreading of the Turing Test (as a litmus test for
'Intelligence'). It is crucial to bear in mind that this dimension of the Turing Test was of no interest to
Turing himself, the question 'Can Machines Think?' being too incoherent to seriously take up as he
did think.
        </p>

        <p>
            Consider two black-boxes as denoting two subjects put to Turing Test with the supervisor tasked to
tell apart the two (human/machine), on the basis of responses generated to a series of questions.
The suggestion, of course, being that it's computably feasible to program a machine (Turing
Machine) that will meticulously mimic the human. The supervisor thus is unable to tell apart the two
and one might thereby conclude that the machine is well capable of human thought/subjectivity.
Searle's experiment involves such a Turing Test where the black-boxes are required to intelligibly
generate responses to corresponding questions in Chinese. His insistence, even if the machine were
to be able to converse adequately, it still does not 'understand' Chinese. Imagine a person (who
does not speak Chinese) equipped with a highly complex set of instructions containing responses to
every possible conversation scenario. This is someone we wouldn't identify as understanding
Chinese and the Turing Machine is here no different. Searle's thesis - Semantics is something other
than the mechanistic regurgitation of instructions/mechanisms.
        </p>
        <p>
            As observed by Noam Chomsky, the paradox of Language as invoking infinitude whilst constituted by
finite symbols (the alphabet) was of great interest to the forerunners of the Scientific Revolution,
transgressing as it were all mechanistic accounts (The Galilean Challenge). There is clearly a
mathematical dimension to this problem, taken up variously by the likes of Cantor (early 20 th
century, apropos 'Different Infinities') and Turing (later 20 th century). The same finds expression in
the Chomsky Hierarchy which categorises grammar as Recursively Enumerable (Unrestricted),
Context-Sensitive, Context-Free and Regular.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, a crucial difference between Searle's or Chomsky's position, in relation to Descartes's, is
that for the latter, Subjectivity pertains to some positive substantial totality overseeing corporeal
interactions. For Searle or Chomsky, Subjectivity is not a substantial difference. Instead, <b>it is a finite
    embodiment of an infinite difference</b> (that takes the form of Substance Dualism in Descartes). That
is, despite the possibility of algorithmic generation of infinities from finite elements, there remains a
concrete difference at the level of complexity. (A complete set of instructions describing all
conversation instances is infinitely complex, whereas language use in everyday life isn't recognised
as an infinitely complex process. [Chomskyan Innatism]) As such, it is required to investigate the
manifold notions of Infinity in this context.
        </p>
        <p>
            Consider the Infinite Monkey Theorem. A monkey randomly hitting keys at a typewriter will, given
enough time, produce highly sophisticated works of literature such as Shakespeare's Hamlet - a fairly
obvious result whose limitations (read: absurdity) are immediately recognisable. Against such an
event, we end up with an unphysical interval of time (greater than the age of the universe etc.).
The distinction, should one hypothesise, remains in it that for the monkey, Infinity (of language)
must be enacted or performed or enforced, whereas for Language proper, the infinity is recognised
as 'always already present' [<b>Reification</b>]. That is, it permeates our everyday experience of language
use; that there is, in the most fundamental sense, an infinite wealth of new sentences within our
linguistic apparatus, harnessed creatively without generative algorithms. In other words, Language is
the most immediate infinity there is.
        </p>

        <p>
            To study this feature of language more keenly, our (human) capacity for language use is innate and
not contained in syntactic manipulation of symbols (as for the monkey), but rather expressed more
creatively through the synthesis of meaning (Semantic dimension).
Consider the sentence - <q>Colourless green ideas sleep furiously.</q> Put forth as a prototypical example
of syntactically sound sentences, which are nonsensical outwardly, Chomsky highlights the necessity
of meaning as motivating language use.
There is a wonderful relational homology here between Meaning/Syntax (Chomsky) and
Subjectivity/Mechanism (Descartes).
A crucial corollary of this line of thought is that such a distinction (Syntax/Semantics) cannot be
made, or appears at best superficial when one considers Formal Language (Formal Semantics isultimately some kind of Syntax). That is, the purported Semantic dimension is strongly held within
the coordinates of the corresponding Symbolic Field.
        </p>

        <p>
            A parallel may be proposed here between aforementioned homologies and Daniel Dennett's notion
of <q>Competence without Comprehension</q>. Let us approach this at the level of everyday experience.
One way or another we have seen (or been) students struggling to answer pedagogical questions,
thus constructing rather helplessly (regurgitating) medleys of dictations (by the professor of course),
evoking keywords, hoping it covers up for conceptual deficiency. And likewise, it has to have
happened with teachers too - stumped at a question, or stuck in an unresolved thought process,
one would typically resort to syntactic manipulations of textbook lines - ergo competence without
comprehension. (A somewhat cynical take, based on Feynman's own view on the matter, is that
much of hitherto existing Quantum Theory is an exercise in competence without comprehension.
The operator algebra is immaculate, agreements with experiments are generally expected, but
nonetheless 'nobody understands quantum physics.')
        </p>

        <p>
            s a counterpoint, comprehension is manifest in the creative articulation of new sentences, new
interpretations, new meaning synthesised upon the symbolic field pertaining to a concept. This is
typically reflected in teachers uniquely identifying the conceptual lapse in hazily, arbitrarily
articulated sentences of a struggling student, let's say, absent from all earthly literature. There is
thus a deep-rooted association between Creativity and Comprehension apropos Subjectivity.
The ontological status of 'Meaning' in relation to 'Symbolic Field' is particularly enigmatic.
Meaning is that which is virtual, absent from the Symbolic Field, but nonetheless actual in how it
determines, operates over the Symbolic Field, rendering it a reified totality - as something more
than a set of symbols, a finite embodiment of an infinite difference (between the naked Symbolic
Field and the same subject to the intentional apparatus of Meaning as in Language proper).
There is a curious (ontological) similarity here between the designation of Meaning (as Constitutive
Deficiency), and the status of Counterfactuals in Chiara Marletto's Constructor Theory (Foundations
of Quantum Theory). This is of course well beyond the scope of this piece and shall remain a
footnote.
        </p>

        <p>
            It is required to approach the notion of Subjectivity on another level, concomitant with prior
developments, along lines of <b>Impossibility of Syntax</b>. There is, as it would appear, a tendency of
our cognitive apparatus to reduce the burden of semantics vis-a-vis syntactic resolution. Take the
menial worker humming melodies in the middle of repetitive, manual labour. The idea being, it is
possible for the said worker to engage in thoughtful music, insofar as his work involves no more than
syntactic regurgitation. Just like very often we find ourselves humming whilst doing dishes etc.
It-s been discussed as to how Formal Semantics is basically held within the coordinates of Formal
Syntax, to the point they are not separable in a significant sense. As such, the Cartesian Space of
Subjectivity must involve an essential antagonism apropos Syntax. Let us approach this on a
somewhat abstract level. Consider the French Revolution and its rallying cries of 'Liberty, Equality,
Fraternity'. Of course, each of the three terms was recognised at the subjective level well before
revolutionary days, reduced even to Syntax. However, it's the very impossibility of a pure syntax,
that finds expression in the historical event, as ascribing meaning to the terms beyond contemporary
hermeneutic horizon.
        </p>

        <p>
            At a more accessible level, consider the following dialogue from Lord of The Rings (Tolkien).
Urug-Hai (some sort of Orc): No man can kill me ... Die!
Eowyn (woman dressed as a man in battle): {Reveals herself} I am no man!
What we see in this dialogue, is a similar shift of categories (of Syntax) - it is clear that the first
instance of 'man' was made as generally asserting the superiority of the Orcs. As such, the reply is
violent in that it explicates this shift, further qualifying 'man' (the species) as man/woman. Similar
instances can be found elsewhere, this (categorical shift) being a ubiquitous rhetorical device, usingas it seems one's words against oneself.
        </p>

        <p>
            Therefore, Subjectivity in and as new Meaning is this very <q>Impossibility of Syntax</q>.
To structure the same formula at a more general level, let's take up the Form-Content Dynamic.
Consider the following films - Barry Lyndon (1975 dir. Stanley Kubrick) and Forrest Gump (1994).
Barry Lyndon would be some sort of a form-centred composition - dialogues are sporadic, the plot is
fairly simple and linear, no extravaganzas at the level of content. The film, noted for its aesthetics
and exquisite cinematography (Form) essentially subdues its Content to ensure coherence - the
general wilderness, melancholia of Irish countryside speaks through the characters. Forrest Gump
lies at the other end of the spectrum - the accompanying aesthetics/scenes of a highly convoluted
storyline appear absurd and as lacking consistency, sincere to its intended Content. To put it in
Freudian terms, what's repressed in Content returns in Form, just as what's repressed in Form
returns in Content. The general scheme pertaining to such a relation describes (what is called)
Overdetermination. (Represented by a Mobius Strip)
        </p>

        <p>
            Such an Overdetermined Scheme bears its own (immanent) logic of temporality, where neither of
the two terms can exist apriori, whilst they're destined to eternally repeat, generating new cycles of
terms at each turn.
Meaning is what makes Syntax impossible, and again it's against this impossibility of Syntax that new
Meaning can be synthesised.
It is interesting to note that an overdetermined scheme describes precisely 'a finite embodiment of
an infinite difference'. There is perpetuity (infinity) inscribed right into its logic of temporality, yet it
remains ostensibly finite ('always already present' as Reification). This may be put forth as the basic
scheme underlying the phenomenon of Emergence.
        </p>

        <p>
            I conclude with a concrete example. With regards to Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules
(QTAIM) by theoretical chemist Richard Bader, it is observed that a similar scheme is embedded in it.
Molecules are made of atoms, but atomic identities are vastly modified as part of an overarching
molecular basis (Overdetermination). Molecularity as it were, is Emergent.
Now, QTAIM accomplishes the retention of (macroscopic) molecular structure as such, where more
orthodox systems such as Molecular Orbital Theory fail. Further, since a series of approximations (to
negotiate with the many-body Schrodinger Wave Equation) essentially renders other theories
incapable of determination (of properties) beyond the simplest cases, QTAIM however remains
potent at this level. Molecules are, in this reductionist scheme, reifications and no more than
organised atomic assemblies.
However, to get to <q>higher simplicities</q> (as seen in QTAIM), <b>reifications must be realised</b>.
