            <h2>The Straight Line</h2>
        </div>
        <p>What is a straight line in Euclid's Elements? Euclid described straight line as <q>breadthless length</q>
            which <q>lies equally with respect to all the points on itself</q>. It is said to be straightest (nowhere
            curved) path between two points. Its uniqueness is assumed in the postulate : Given two points there
            exists a unique straight line joining them. Now it is easy to relate this description to our perception
            of straight line. But in a formal sense, this does not qualify as a definition. Here the straight line, or
            rather the notion of straightness is a primitive one. </p>
            <p>
                On the other hand, there is another approach forwarded by Descartes, Hilbert, Riemann and others -
                the metric approach. In Euclid's system it is proved by the fundamental postulates and various
                results such as triangle inequality that the straight line is the shortest path between two points in 2 or
                3 dimensions. However, in metric approach, primitively straight line is defined to be the path
                between two points which has shortest distance. Now, this distance is denoted by a metric function
                which gives non-negative real values and follows triangle inequality. And in <span class="math display">ℝ<sup>2</sup></span> or <span class="math display">ℝ<sup>3</sup></span>
                the chosen
                metric is the Cartesian distance and it works fine with our general intuition of physical space. All
                the results of Euclid's Elements in <span class="math display">ℝ<sup>2</sup></span> or <span class="math display">ℝ<sup>3</sup></span>
                 hold perfectly by starting from metric too. So one might
                argue that Euclid's geometric space is an immediate result of us being submerges in the physical
                space which has all the same properties. Obviously in Newtonian mechanics space is isometric,
                homogenous and Euclidean and that never worked against intuition. But today we know of
                numerous geometries and discuss about larger classes of geometries among which Euclid is just a
                special case. We can talk about geometries where parallel lines are not always equidistant or sum of
                internal angles of a triangle is not twice a right angle. One might argue that we have developed
                some analytic tools and now we can generalise the results of Euclid to larger classes of geometries
                and can think of different approaches to form such geometries. But however, Euclid's geometry is
                the natural one because it does not require any training in abstract logic or mathematics, even the
                uninitiated child intuitively think that physical space is Euclidean.
            </p>
            <p>Now let us look at the Relativity Theory of Einstein. Einstein considers space-time to be nonEuclidean. Experiments have proven that in presence of heavy object light rays can bend. In general
                relativity gravitational force is caused by curvatures in space-time which cause objects to move in
                certain directions (along the curved path). By the principle of least action, the geodesics or shortest
                path in its initial direction is followed by a travelling ray of light. The fact that it bends near heavy
                objects indicate that the geodesics are not straight lines there, rather they are themselves curved. But
                Einstein showed that space-time follows a hyperbolic geometry. However, space without the time
                coordinate (or better to say space at a given time instance) is still Euclidean. But universe is
                expanding and if we incorporate time only then the four dimensional space-time continuum is nonEuclidean.</p>

                    <h2>The Problem of Primitive Notions</h2>
                </div> 
                <p>Now if we look at the approach in Elements, we agree to the description of straight line because we
                    can associate with it our understanding of straight line from experience. However there is no
                    definite affirmation in saying <q>the straightest path between to points</q>. Straightness implies there is
                    no change in direction. It is true that change of direction can be understood by angles in 2D. But
                    again angle is determined by two straight lines and direction lies just along a straight line. One can
                    see the circularity of establishing primitive notions in pure analytic terms. The same is true when
                    we understand straight line by shortest distance. We can measure distance only by using preferably
                    a rigid body as a unit - distance is understood as nothing but length vis-a-vis the idea of line
                    segment. In this sense, geometry initiates from synthetic knowledge. But we know that we can not 
                    draw a straight line or circle or any of the nice figures in geometry up to infinite precision in real
                    life. Then what do we really understand by straight line or circle if we can not exactly identify the
                    object of geometry (say a straight line proper) and the object of perception (say the straight line
                    drawn on paper with very small yet positive breadth)? Plato had an answer for this. Plato said that
                    the idea of straightness or circleness (the property of being a circle) reside in our mind as pure idea
                    and all the physical lines or circles are just realization of these ideas. Circles or straight lines are not
                    in the physical space, there are only distortions or manifestations of the pure ideal. Plato's essential
                    idea was that the Real is subject to knowledge (say, Euclidean Geometry) and it is only our
                    empirical investigation (say, Visual Geometry) that leads to distortion from the Real.</p>

                        <h2>The Kantian Argument </h2>
                    </div> 

                    <p>
                        German philosopher Immanuel Kant demonstrated a flaw in Plato’s scheme. Abstract reasoning
                        must be independent of individual human understanding. Therefore we can not have a priori
                        abstract knowledge about the Real which we can forward to further reasoning. It is only through
                        passive observation of sensible world and active synthesis of the sensible data can knowledge
                        initiate and only then we can understand the a priori form of our understanding by reflecting upon
                        the process of the aforementioned synthesis. Kant said that the conception of space, however, is
                        synthetic a priori. By means of externality we have the intuition about space – which is realised as
                        the difference in place between objects external to us as opposed to their difference in their
                        properties within themselves. Kant establishes the limit of human understanding to be the horizon
                        of the possibilities of sensibility. So straight line or any geometric object, Kant says, is the
                        idealisation of some observable objects synthesized through our intuition of space. So the Kantian
                        take would be as following: Our intuition of space that is a priori within the form of understanding
                        makes us see the physical reality in a Euclidean three dimensional space. Euclid reflects on the most
                        fundamental intuition about geometric objects which he can do by associating our experience of the
                        physical correspondents of those objects with their abstract form in pure geometry. This intuitive
                        association is established by the aforementioned primitive notions. However, no claims can be made
                        about the Truth of the pure physical space. 
                    </p>

                    <div align="left"> 
                        <h2>Real Is Rational And Rational Is Real</h2>
                    </div> 

                    <p>
                        Plato and Kant both commits to one thing - that is the Real exists independent of us - static, perfect
and complete; and we by our sensory and analytic apparatus try to understand it. Kant further says,
it is impossible to know the Real as it is. Another German philosopher Georg Wilhelm Friedrich
Hegel put a different question before us - what exactly is this Real? That the thing-in-itself beyond
our sensible possibility is unknowable is a knowledge of the thing-in-itself itself. By this argument
Hegel rejects the possibility of absolute unknowability. The Real is not the absolute state of things
in themselves, rather it is the dynamicity of the things. Our experience encounters premises that are
at the same time opposite but each exists only with respect to the other - they are each others'
negation and affirmation. It is in our understanding that we synthesize them in order to resolve the
contradiction and then move onto the next agenda. This is the scheme of the Real vis-a-vis the
Rational - the scheme of Dialectics. So let us now try to apply this to questions regarding geometry
and space. 
                    </p>

            <p>Take the straight line. Have you ever drawn a perfect straight line? Or have anyone ever perceived
                perfect breadthless length? It is not possible (The finest microscope can not see breadthlessness).
                Then how do we understand what Euclid meant by straight line without any hardship? One thing
                that we obviously experience physically is the sense of direction (simply by the ability to point out
                at something). So now if there are two objects and I start from one pointing towards the other I can 
                walk along a path to reach the other object (Let us forget for this moment that I am walking on a
                non-planar earth) while pointing to it constantly. It is a very concrete experience. Now since we can
                talk about constant direction, we have to consider the possibility of changing direction as well. This
                requires at least a (planar) surface where infinitely many directions are possible. These directions
                are distinct insofar that they point away from each other, but they are also similar since property of
                space itself is unaltered along any one of them. So the notion of the straightness is the negation of
                possibilities of direction and at the same time affirmation of a particular direction. </p>

                <p>So now we have the <q>straight</q> in <q>straight line</q>. But before that we have to figure out what is
                    <q>line</q>. Euclid defined line as a breadthless length. So let us understand the notion of distance or
                    length. And distance can be understood in terms of duration. Kant said that time is the a priori
                    intuition of our internality -realised as the order or interval in which we perceive several events
                    either among external objects or internal thought. Now if we start from one point and reach another,
                    it will involve a time duration to travel the path. Now if we measure the distance along this path
                    with a rigid body such as a ruler, both end points of that ruler is determined simultaneously. In this
                    sense distance becomes both preservation of the information about the duration as well as its
                    negation. And up to this the notion of length is clear to us. Now what do we understand by saying
                    the length is breadthless? We said straightness is determination of one direction along all the points
                    on the path. But for any line, straight or curved, breadthlessness indicated the determination of
                    unique direction at a given point. That is, the direction allowed on point can be different from
                    another point, but that one point must allow only one direction. And then we have breadthlessness.
                    So once through determination of direction and then through determination of duration we reach at
                    an object which is <q>a breadthless length that lies equally to all points on it</q> that is the Straight Line.
                    When we say straight line extends infinitely in both direction we simply mean that if our space
                    allows we can keep walking on a fixed direction forever, without stopping. It is also not hard to say
                    that shortest path between two points is the path where it takes least time to travel that is along the
                    path where we do not change the direction multiple times. So the metric intuition is equally sound
                    in our scheme of determination of direction and duration. </p>

                    <p>
                        Interestingly if we are given two points quite far away, it is unlikely we can draw the (physical)
                        straight line joining them in the first attempt. It is easier to find first the shortest path and then claim
                        it is the straightest path. However intuitively we know about the straightest path first and then
                        conclude it is shortest. Thus Euclid's approach was more intuitive and experiential. But Descartes's
                        approach is much more sophisticated and precise since it builds itself on Euclidean synthetic
                        intuition combined with analytic method of Algebra. Let us reserve the dialogue between Algebra
                        and Geometry for another essay.

                        <h2>Addendum</h2>
                    </div> 

                    <p>The Hegelian scheme equates reality not with the hidden truth behind appearance. There is no true
                        reality deep beneath the surface. It's all on the surface. And all of it is in motion, the universe is
                        becoming, insofar that it is Not absolute, static, permanent, perfect. Universe itself is imperfect
                        similar to our cognition of it. This is quite visible in our development from Newtonian mechanics to
                        theory of relativity. Newton considered the physical space to be independent of us - homogenous,
                        static, absolute. And time is also absolute insofar that a given time interval is same for every object
                        in the universe. Einstein showed that space and time is relativistic. But not only that. Let us imagine
                        there is a point mass. Mass corresponds to inertia - that resists change in motion. Acceleration is
                        change in motion and thus a negation to mass. So for this two concrete category to be synthesized
                        Newton defined force as the external agent causing the change. Newton went farther to demonstrate                         that any object with mass exerts a gravitational force on other masses. However he could not
                        elucidate what causes this gravitational force. Einstein surprisingly showed that it is space-time
                        itself, or rather curvature in space-time caused by mass that causes gravitational force. But then
                        what is mass - that what causes curvature in space-time. To simplify all these is as such: Newton
                        had absolute Euclidean space and absolute time and also mass and gravitational force caused by
                        mass. Einstein then sublated absolute space and time in non-Euclidean relativistic space-time and
                        sublated mass and gravity in curvature of the same space-time. And thus we are here with a better
                        developed, sophisticated model of the universe, with a better understanding of reality.</p>
